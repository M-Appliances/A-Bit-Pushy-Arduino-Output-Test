# A-Bit-Pushy-Output-Test
This code is really useful to test out your A Bit Pushy device.  It makes all the LEDs flash & the buzzer buzz.  Once you know everything is wired up correctly, you can then flash the proper app onto the device by going here: [https://github.com/pantri/A-Bit-Pushy](https://github.com/pantri/A-Bit-Pushy).
